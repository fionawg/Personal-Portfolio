            I'm currently a senior at Brooklyn Technical High School in Brooklyn, New York. I plan on 
            majoring in Computer Science and becoming a software engineer. As a student, I have a lot 
            of experience with Computer Science because my school is a technical school that offers 
            many classes related to computer science. Through these classes, I was able to discover 
            my passion for programming.
